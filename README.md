# IEEE 754 Demonstrations

This repository contains a series of programs demonstrating various aspects of IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic in both Python and Java. The examples include handling of rounding, overflow, underflow, invalid operations, and precision loss. The aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of IEEE 754 behavior through different scenarios.

Java IEEE 754 Demonstration

This Java program demonstrates the handling of IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic using the BigDecimal class. It includes examples of:

    Rounding
    Overflow
    Underflow
    Invalid operations

How to Run

    Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
    Compile the Java program using the command:
    javac Ieee754Demo.java
Run the compiled program using the command:
java Ieee754Demo

Arithmetic Operations

This Python script demonstrates the difference in arithmetic operations using standard floating-point arithmetic and the Decimal class for more accurate arithmetic. The script includes:

    Addition
    Division

How to Run

    Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    Run the script using the command:
    python arithmetic_operations.py

IEEE 754 Conversion

This Python script demonstrates how to convert a float to its IEEE 754 binary string representation and tests the conversion for normal and edge cases.
How to Run

    Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    Run the script using the command:
    python ieee754_conversion.py

Rounding Modes

This Python script demonstrates different rounding modes using the decimal module. The script includes examples of rounding a number in various modes:

    ROUND_CEILING
    ROUND_DOWN
    ROUND_FLOOR

How to Run

    Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    Run the script using the command:
    python rounding_modes.py

Infinity and NaN

This Python script demonstrates handling of positive infinity, negative infinity, and NaN (Not a Number) values.
How to Run

    Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    Run the script using the command:
    python infinity_and_nan.py

Underflow and Overflow

This Python script demonstrates the handling of underflow and overflow in decimal calculations using the decimal module.
How to Run

    Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    Run the script using the command:
    python underflow_and_overflow.py

Precision Loss Visualization

This Python script visualizes precision loss for very small and very large numbers using the numpy and matplotlib libraries.
How to Run

    Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (numpy and matplotlib) installed on your system. You can install the libraries using the command:

        pip install numpy matplotlib

    Run the script using the command:

        python precision_loss_visualization.py
